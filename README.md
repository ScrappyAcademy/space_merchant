space_merchant
==============

Individual project to learn essential ruby programming skills. 

Space Merchant is <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz71.html">Ruby Programming Quiz #71.</a> <br/>
In this project we'll use Ruby to build an interactive game. The premise of the game is simple: you play a space trader flying around the galaxy buying and selling goods. The main goal is to find places to buy goods at a low price and then unload those goods at another location with a higher price, turning a profit.

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Learn essential Ruby programming skills</li>
<li>Become familiar with <a href="http://git-scm.com/book">Git</a> for version control</li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<br/>
<h3>Step 1 - Fork the space_merchant repository</h3>
The code in the inital space_merchant repository provides us with two objects:
<p>The Player Object - centralized storage for game state information e.g. how much money the player has</p>
<p>The Event Loop - the options a player has available at any given time, which are a function of where they are e.g. while flying through space a player can select a destination but when docked commands center around buying and selling goods</p>


<li>Step 1 - Create the Galaxy (An object that represents space as a whole) 
<p>The Galaxy is responsible for creating all of the game locations and allowing event code to access these locations. Event code gives the player some choices, fetches an action from the keyboard, and responds appropriately. </p>
